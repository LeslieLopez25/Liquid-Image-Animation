<h1>Liquid Animation</h1>

<h2>A liquid animation effect created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This website is mostly using a few CSS custom properties while the effect on the image is using JavaScript. I created this following the tutorial of Dev Ed. I've changed the color scheme, images, and updated the values of measures from px to rem. This is a beginner friendly project just to show an animation effect using three.js on an image.</p>
